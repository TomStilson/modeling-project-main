# CISC/CMPE 204 Modelling Project

Welcome to the major project for CISC/CMPE 204 (Fall 2021)!

The NBA is the highest-level and most popular professional basketball league in the world. In general, each team needs to play 82 games during the regular season. This project aims to explain how to arrange a complete season for a team in NBA.
In our project, we select a team from Central zone, Eastern conference.

## Structure

* `documents`: Contains folders for both of your draft and final submissions. README.md files are included in both.
* `run.py`: General wrapper script that you can choose to use or not. Only requirement is that you implement the one function inside of there for the auto-checks.
* `test.py`: Run this file to confirm that your submission has everything required. This essentially just means it will check for the right files and sufficient theory size.

## Members
* **Yiting Ma** - In charge of modeling report formatting and LaTeX writing, result formatting and sorting python code.
* **Pround Sawyer** - In charge of report content writing.
* **Kevin Jiang** - In charge of coding with bauhaus, creating propositions and constraints in python code.

## Pointers

* `documents\final\report.pdf`: The modeling report for our project.
* `documents\final\proofs.jp`: The JAPE proof file for our project.
* `run.py`: The main script that contains our proposition, constraints and result generating code.
